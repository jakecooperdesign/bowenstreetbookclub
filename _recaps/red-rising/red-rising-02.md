Don’t get too excited, because everything’s about to get a lot worse.

Despite Darrow’s sacrifices, and despite what seemed an apparent victory over the Gammas, the Reds have wound up in second place. It seems the game was rigged from the start with the victor chosen ahead of time. Before he makes a move he’ll regret, Eo distracts him, leading him to a secret passage in the Webbery. 

They emerge in a secret garden with flora and fauna, and sky above their heads — experiences they’ve never had as subterranean Reds. They christen their discovery as only two consenting adults can, and afterwards Eo unveils her silent anger and dissatisfaction with how society treats the Reds. 
She argues with Darrow that the circumstances their people are in have been forced rather than chosen, despite the story that has been told painting Reds as the pseudo-martyrs of humanity. She urges him to use his talent and prestige as a helldiver to rally the clans against the government. Eo is left heartbroken as Darrow explains his pragmatic rationale that rebelling will only endanger them further. 

A patrolling police force catch Eo and Darrow leaving the secret garden and arrest them. Before the two are separated, Eo whispers, “break the chains, my love”.

At the televised sentencing, they are joined by the (in)famous Gold ArchGovernor of Mars, Nero au Augustus, and his crew. He is flanked by two Crows — giant Obsidian men adorned in black armor and skull helmets. They are bred for war and have massive, eight-fingered hands. The ArchGovernor sentences Darrow and Eo to be whipped, which is performed ceremoniously by family members rather than police. Darrow struggles, but takes his punishment. But as Eo is struck, despite Darrow’s pleading, she sings the forewarned song that is punishable by death in defiance of the sentencing both they and all Reds have been dealt. Augustus challenges her fellow Reds to join in her treason which, as predicted by Darrow, no one has the courage to do. The chapter ends with Eo sentenced to death by hanging.


## Extras


### There’s a Secret Garden in the Ventilation Shaft…
It feels weird to call it a secret garden, but that’s totally what it is. I’m not sure if a hidden garden is some show of luxury, or if the garden also has some functional utility for the other colors to benefit from. If this weren’t *hell-scape* Mars and some Earthly countryside, a secret garden seems like an almost aristocratic show of affluence, but this is Matt-Damon-in-the-Martian Mars, where resources seem scarce, and humanity is in a state of migration. I feel like when you’re on a planet that is inhospitable to your species, even your luxuries necessitate some functional benefits beyond stickin’ it to the lower class.

### Eo Sings Her Final Song
The song Eo sings that seals the deal on her martyrdom hints at a time when the Golds waged war on the other colors and enslaved their opposition. Obviously this is foreshadowing for what is to come (as indicated by that epic prelude), but does this mean that it is also a regular occurrence? The song calls them *reapers*, which in one sense implies a seasonality / repetition to their actions. Is a *reaping* or *culling* of the low-born colors a systematic action built into this dystopia’s design?

### Setting the Stage for Darrow’s Rebellion
It’s nice to see Darrow as a pragmatic protagonist, he has honest and logical reasons why defying the system will not work out for him. Attention is being paid to the fact that, unlike other hero-archetypal stories, he is not the outlier, with all the ability to change and achieve what he wants. Rather, it is through the efforts of the group, acting as one, that will bring about this change. I feel like this sets Darrow on a path to enlist the help of others rather that acquire the skills to do what only he alone can do. This feels less like a spy story and more like a war story. 


## Assorted Musings and Predictions

- Of course Darrow’s clan doesn’t get the Laurel… of course!
- Lots of family doing the dirty work in this penal system.
- Those black Crows sound insane! Definitely worth a google to see the fan art depictions of these guys.
