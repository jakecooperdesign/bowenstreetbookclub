Darrow visits the surface of Mars and must endure a drastic change to carryout Eo’s dream.

Dancer brings Darrow above ground for the first time, unveiling a bustling city full of luxuries, extravagant technology, and life. He learns that the Golds have mined not just Mars but all of the planets, and have kept the Reds in the dark to continue profiting off their sacrifice. 

After Darrow learns the truth, Dancer unveils his plan: to surgically transform him into the body of a Gold so that he may ascend their ranks as an empowered spy for the Sons of Ares. Dancer has recruited many for this task before, but they could not withstand the painful surgeries needed, but he knows the source of Darrow’s strength. He knows that Darrow had survived the bite of a venomous pitviper, whose venom cannot leave the blood system. Darrow’s body would either die or adapt to the venom’s effect, and Darrow grew stronger.

Reluctant to become a part in another person’s plan, Darrow accepts and undergoes the year’s worth of surgeries from the Carver, Mickey. The self-centered club owner, Mickey uses his abilities to create amusements for his guests for notoriety and profit — amusements which challenge his ability to create, where Gold restrictions do not. One such creation is the winged Evey, who is tasked with tending to Darrows wounds as they heal. 

A year’s worth of pain and regrowth have transformed Darrow into the appearance of a gold, large, statuesque, and intimidating. Once able, he is trained by Harmony into a true threat his classmates won’t be able to ignore at the Institute — the first step in the way of Darrow’s ascension through Golden notoriety.

Before leaving the watchful care of Mickey, Darrow uses his newfound strength and power to intimidate him into freeing Evey from his service. Mickey does so while admiring his greatest creation.

## Extras

### Venom

I love that what enables/compels Darrow to be so strong is a distinctly Martian accident. A pitviper’s venom is more often fatal than not, and Dancer’s lame arm is the typical result when  the person is saved, so to see Darrow not only alive, but stronger because of the constant struggle and adaptation his heart must endure to combat and maintain the venom in his bloodstream is immensely symbolic of Darrow’s character. 

If we take the pitviper’s venom as a symbol for Mars, the struggle his body must put up in order to survive it’s constant presence parallels Darrow’s immense will to persist amongst the harsh conditions of Martian and Societal rule. In wake of Darrow’s transformation, it also serves as a reminder of his upbringing despite how different he may need to appear as he infiltrates Gold territory. As much as this is a positive connection for Darrow, his ability to deceive the Golds is what will determine his success, and although it would be far-fetched to test someone’s blood for the presence of venom, I can’t help but note this as possible foreshadowing that Darrow may be outed as a Red, with the only undeniable bit of proof.

### The Nature of Power

The strength Darrow receives from the venom is ultimately symbolic of the relationship of the Golds and the Reds. It begs the question if through their own rigged system have they also created the situations for that system to be overthrown, a la Darrow? Without the Golds enslavement of the Reds, forcing them to work the mines, Darrow may not have ever been bitten by the pitviper, which may not have set him on the path to tear the whole thing down. Throughout Pierce Brown’s writing, there seems to be an undertone of questioning the nature of power and rule, and learning about the Golds’ involvement in creating their successor, Brown continues to lay the groundwork for that endeavor. My early hypothesis is that Brown intends to teach of the delicate balance of power, but I could be wrong based on the coming chapters. 

### Fathers

In these chapters we learn that Dancer and Darrow have an even deeper connection as they are both among the very few who have survived a pitviper’s bite. In many ways Darrow draws similarities to Dancer: through their upbringing, their compulsion to end the Golds’ tyranny, and their ability to sacrifice in order to achieve their goals. Through their venomous connection, Darrow continues to represent the person Dancer wishes he could be. Darrow has the ability to carryout Dancer’s plan, and the strength to undergo the necessary transformation where Dancer cannot. In Dancers’ persistence to guide Darrow in achieving their mutual goal, and his intentions to pass on his beliefs about the Golds to Darrow, Dancer could be considered a father figure to Darrow. Though he’s reluctant to be swayed by someone else’s ideology, Darrow must make the choice children must make between blindly following the beliefs of their parents or holding strong to their own.

Where Dancer embodies a father to Darrow in mind and spirit, Mickey is a father to him in the physical sense. Mickey treats Darrow as his creation and is resonant to the responsibility associated with creating life. Darrow, despite differences in beliefs and status and demeanor, is without question connected to Mickey as his creator, echoing the idea that parents, no matter how different from their children, are forever connected with their children. And like a parent, Mickey is genuinely concerned with Darrow’s well being. And like a parent, Mickey treats Darrow like a representation of himself and selfishly revels in the role he has played in birthing the great man Darrow is destined to become. This responsibility and excitement frustrates Evey — another symbolic child, another creation, of Mickey’s — much in the way a child would be frustrated with a parent displaying favoritism.

### Children

Evey has a short and sweet interaction with Darrow in these chapters. Evey resents her creation into one of Mickey’s amusements, but rather than be jealous of the attention and importance placed on Darrow, she says nothing. Evey and Darrow are connected through Mickey, as much as they have been changed into something new, he has stripped away who they used to be, and Evey is more than aware of the alienation Mickey can effect. The only words Evey says to Darrow are “you’re beautiful”, which is hauntingly objective and sentencing in its means of remorsefully cementing  their kinship.

## Assorted Musings and Predictions
- Possible attraction between Evey and Darrow? Gotta happen at some point over the trilogy.
- Harmony's training center with artificial gravity is totally tingled my Dragon Ball Z receptors in the best way.
- If Darrow has to be transformed into a Gold totally and Martian pitviper venom can never leave your bloodstream... well then, Mickey, you missed a spot! If this isn't used as the one identifier that outs Darrow, I'm going to facepalm myself to death.
