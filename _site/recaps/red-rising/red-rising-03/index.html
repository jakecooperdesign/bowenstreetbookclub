		<p>Twist after twist in these chapters, Darrow is in for the ride of his life as well as his worst nightmare.</p>

<p>After the previous chapter’s sentencing, chapter six begins with Eo’s televised hanging. She uses her last moments to urge the world to “break the chains”, as Darrow’s worst nightmare comes to life. Darrow’s is overcome with sadness and rage, as he cannot bear leaving Eo’s lifeless body in the public square to serve as the Gold’s reminder of what happens to those who defy their law. Darrow decides that the only way he can honor their love is to give her a proper burial, despite the consequences.</p>

<p>Darrow lays to rest Eo in the secret garden they discovered, despite his family’s protests, and is sentenced to death for his crime shortly after returning home. Surrounded by his family, Darrow is hung in front of the community just like his late wife.</p>

<p>…But Darrow is alive! He awakes many hours after his hanging underground and digs himself free with the last of his strength. The hanging was somehow faked by his uncle Narol and members of the Sons of Ares, who are trying to recruit Darrow to their cause. The Sons discuss their intentions and beliefs with Darrow, and after patching up his wounds he is taken up an elevator shaft until it reaches the surface of Mars. Darrow and his fellow Reds have sacrificed their lives for centuries mining the resources necessary to one day transform the harsh Martian surface into a safe haven for humanity, but Darrow does not see the landscape he has been fighting so hard to change. Through the surface room’s glass window, Darrow marvels at the vast, populous city in front of him.</p>

<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>

<h3 id="the-sons-of-ares">The Sons of Ares</h3>
<p>It seems the Sons of Ares have more covert operations in play besides their bombings. Darrow’s perspective of them as a terrorist group, bent only on destruction seemed like a bit of an obvious misdirect, but I’m curious to learn more about their grand plan in the scheme of this story. For now, we learn that they are looking for ‘outliers’ like Darrow, which are the few worthy of knowing the truth about the lies deceiving the Red population.</p>

<h3 id="uncle-narol">Uncle Narol</h3>
<p>When Uncle Narol is chatting with Darrow before he goes to bury Eo, he leaves him while saying, “give my brothers a toast and my wife a kiss, especially Dancer”. We learn from Dancer that Uncle Narol has served as an informant for the Sons of Ares, but I wonder if his involvement goes deeper than that. Given the ability for them to fake Darrow’s death, I wonder if Narol’s statement was meant literally, that his family is still alive and members of the Sons just like Darrow may be. It may have been a toss-in to not tip Darrow off, but there were many masked and codenamed characters in that van, it’s possible they could have been Narol’s brothers or wife.</p>

<h3 id="eo-as-a-symbol">Eo as a Symbol</h3>
<p>The tricky thing with symbolic acts is that you can’t control other people’s perception of it. Darrow refuses to let the Gold’s use Eo’s remains as a symbol/example of how rebellion is stamped out, while at the same time the Sons use Eo for their own cause, portraying her as a martyr as a catalyst for necessary defiance and unrest against Red oppressors by portraying her as a martyr. Darrow’s attempt to control Eo’s symbolism is useless as the powers at play can control the interpretation through the media — they both use the same recordings of the hanging to get their message across.</p>

<p>I think Darrow’s protests against the Sons’ usage of Eo to further their own agenda, despite their shared interest in empowering the Reds (making them seem like the “good guys”), is foreshadowing a future conflict over what is best for the Reds once Gold’s rule is destroyed. Darrow’s beliefs don’t always align with the Sons of Ares — I smell a twist coming!</p>

<h2 id="assorted-musings-and-predictions">Assorted Musings and Predictions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Perhaps Eo’s death won’t be the rally cry needed to mobilize the Reds when there’s a freaking city on the surface they don’t know about!</li>
  <li>Why haven’t the Sons shown the Reds the true surface of Mars, and unveiled the Golds for the liars that they are? I bet we’ll find out the Sons are keeping the truth from the Reds for their own selfish reasons, but have believable excuses as to why they can’t — I don’t trust them yet…</li>
  <li>I thought it was funny that Eo’s death seemed to take two chapters, but when we get to Darrow’s it only took a quarter. It was kind of like the author was going, “okay, you know the drill here: gavel, rope, crack, and we’re out”.</li>
