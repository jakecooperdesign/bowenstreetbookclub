		<p>It’s been 700 years since Earth began colonizing other planets in the solar systemic and the divides between those who work for the “greater good” of humanity and those who see the benefits are about to come tumbling down.</p>

<p>Humanity has evolved into separate races grouped into castes known as colors. Each has their own characteristics and genetic differences which paved the way for a separated social order. Golds are placed at the top of the pyramid, Greys the designated police force for society, while Reds are at the very bottom.</p>

<p>Reds are genetically stronger than the other races which has forced their designation as the manual laborers of humanity. They perform the variety of jobs unworthy of the other races, but the majority of Reds mine underground for helium-3 — a valuable resource used to terraform Mars into a hospitable environment for the other (weaker) colors, though it is unclear if that process has begun already or is awaiting a certain supply of helium-3 before beginning. The Reds are historically acknowledged as pioneers whose sacrifice and toil will save the human race, yet publicly they are treated more like the outcasts of society, a genetic subset of human born too simple and ignoble to fit into the rest of society.</p>

<p><em>Red Rising</em> is the story of Darrow, a 16 year old Red working on a dystopian Martian mining colony. He’s a helldiver, one of the risky few who operate the tentacle-like machines that burrow and mine into the soil to collect the helium-3. There are 24 clans of Reds on Mars, each competing to mine the most helium per quarter for the food and resources needed to keep them alive. The clan that mines the most helium wins the Laurel, a surplus of resources and luxuries that is meant to incentivize and create competition amongst the clans, while the others who meet the quota get just enough to survive, and those who cannot keep up are given even less. The Laurel is so valuable that the resources gained have perpetuated a winning streak by one clan while the others suffer.</p>

<p>Reds are supposedly a simple, romantic people, who counterbalance their rigorous work with activities they can afford — singing and dancing after hours. We haven’t learned all of the rules that govern the Reds, but what we do know is that some dances and songs, deemed treasonous have been made illegal, and performing them is punishable by hanging. Darrow’s father is is one such peaceful resistor, who stood firm to his beliefs and performed the dance which cost him his life when Darrow was young, which left Darrow to be raised by his uncle, a notorious drunk, who seems to cowardly to challenge his oppressors, though there’s been hints that he may know more than he lets on.</p>

<p>Darrow determination and willingness to take risks for the betterment of his clan have made him a top ranking helldiver, and earned them the top spot towards winning the Laurel this quarter, breaking the long-held streak by a rival clan. The chapter ends with Darrow and his wife, Eo, heading to the quarter’s end banquet where the earnings are given out.</p>

<h3 id="dat-first-page-dow">Dat First Page Dow</h3>

<p>I started reading this book on my train ride home last week and from the first page (before chapter 1 begins) I was hooked. Way to setup the premise for the book in one freaking page! Before we get the backstory for the characters, Pierce Brown flash-forwards us to Darrow spying on a nazi-esque Gold rally (very General Hux addressing the First Order if you know what I mean), readying them for an upcoming war with the other classes — or maybe just the Reds, we’ll find that out later. But the stage is set: class warfare on a dystopian Martian mining colony where the underdog miners are prepared to fight back against their oppressors.</p>

<h3 id="everythings-a-remix">Everything’s A Remix</h3>

<p>There are some pretty obvious references to other famous sci-fi and fantasy novels influencing <em>Red Rising</em>, but I’m buying the premise so I’ll allow it. I picked up on the <em>Hunger Games</em>-style war over food, <em>Dune</em>-like still suits the Hell Divers wear, and even some <em>Footloose</em>-y “no singing’ and dancin’”. Despite the borrowed influences, I appreciate the setting of the story. The idea of a Martian mining colony in the middle of a class war sounds like a mashup of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>There Will Be Blood</em> set in hell!</p>

<h3 id="the-heros-journey-rubric">The Hero’s Journey Rubric</h3>

<p>So far Darrow is a pretty typical Hero in the midst of his hero’s journey: he’s part of an oppressed group of outcasts in a society stacked against him, yet he has a the determination and skills to possible break the mold for his family. As soon as they started painting Eo as this sweet, innocent wife, I started the countdown until something bad happens to her (don’t read the amazon description for the book if you want to avoid spoilers). She’ll be taken away from Darrow somehow which will be the last straw, compelling him to take the fight to the top.</p>

<h3 id="assorted-musings-and-predictions">Assorted Musings and Predictions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When people are sentenced to death they’re hanged and their skeleton is left as a reminder to everyone else, fucking brutal!</li>
  <li>To top it off, there’s not enough gravity to break your neck when being hanged, so your family pulls you down until it breaks, family being Darrow in this scenario — that’s some Arya Stark level baddass foreshadowing, I can see him screaming “I wasn’t born a killer, I was made one”.</li>
  <li>So much lingo in the first couple chapters without explanation it’s hard to keep track. Same with the distinctions between the different colors and how this caste system came about. Though if this book is like the millions other fantasy/sci-fi books out there, there will be plenty of backstory pounded into each chapter a la George R. R. Martin.</li>
  <li>The easy prediction is that Eo is going down, one way or another, compelling Darrow to become a badass.</li>
  <li>I bet Darrow’s Uncle Narol (or Loran? the fact that you would name your son with the reverse spelling of your name is SO insanely confusing, I’m just gunna keep referring to him as Darrow’s Uncle) knows more about the inner workings of the caste system and has more of a reason to be afraid/careful about making waves.</li>
  <li>I’d say there’s a 99% chance Darrow’s clan ain’t getting that Laurel — no idea how they’ll justify it, but there’ll be some justification to keep denying the other clans their due.</li>
</ul>
