    I'm **Jake Cooper**, your very own designer-developer-writer-nerd hybrid who makes bad jokes, branding, and websites. I studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and earned a Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts in Graphic Design with a concentration in writing, which lead me to New York City where I work as a Graphic Designer. When outside the hours of 9 to 5, I run a small [design studio](jakecooperdesign.com) that helps make branding and websites for small businesses and passion projects.

## I know what you're thinking... <span class="is-visible-md"><br></span>another club I don't have time for.

I'm a lover of pop culture: TV, Movies, Music, Art, Comics, and Books (note the capitalization). But with a pendulous work-life balance, it's hard to commit to a club or a meetup or any other trendy equivalent. So I wanted to create something that was still fun whether or not you had the time each week.

This book club is completely on-demand. I've made my weekly recaps/commentary available online so if you miss a week, or are waiting for when your schedule is less demanding, you can still join in whenever you want. You'll get the same versions in your inbox when they're posted, and you can just delete them, or save them until you're ready.

Low stakes. Good time. Let's relax and read a book together. Nerdiness appreciated, but not required&ensp;<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>
