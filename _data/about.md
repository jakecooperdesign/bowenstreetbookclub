I love reading, but I’m definitely not the world’s best reader. I’ve got a lot on my mind and even more on my plate. I get my reading in when I can, but I never seem to have anyone to talk to about it. Sometimes I’ll read a book a friend recommends, but when I want to talk to them about it, they don’t remember the chapter I’m up to, and often they can’t help but spoil the ending.

Through this book club, I’m going to read a book at an easy pace and send out an email with a recap and some thoughts to those that want to read along with me. If you don’t have time right now, or read at a slower pace, the recaps are online so you can get to them when you’re ready. Add your thoughts and questions in a comment, or join my slack team to chat in-between chapters.
